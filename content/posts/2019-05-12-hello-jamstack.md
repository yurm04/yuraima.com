Last month I attended [JAMstack Conf](https://jamstackconf.com/nyc/) at the enthusiastic persistence of a [friend](https://twitter.com/natalyathree).  She'd mentioned the JAMstack a few times before, raving about how easy it is to set up and the unbelievably fast sites that can come out of it.  I was initially skeptical, assuming this was just the overly-excited bragging of a shiny, new tech stack that we're all guilty of at some point.  Today, I'm happy to admit that I was **dead wrong**.

The [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) is a front-end architecture strategy that leverages **J**avaScript, **A**PIs, and **M**arkdown to create static web sites.  If you're reaching for your pitchforks and torches at the idea of going back to static sites like it's 1999, you're not alone.  My biggest complaint about the JAMstack – before knowing anything about it – was the _static_ part of it.  We've come so far in the world of web development with the advancements of JavaScript, CSS, and web browsers.  It feels like a betrayal to go from the vibrant, dynamic, _living_ sites we have now back to boring static pages.

What I didn't know at the time was that _static_ doesn't mean _stale_ anymore.  With the JAMstack it's entirely possible to create dynamic sites with all the bells and whistles, while benefitting from fast page loads
